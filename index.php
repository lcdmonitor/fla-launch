                    Model rocketry in education offers students a hands-on approach to learning STEM concepts. By designing, building, and launching rockets, students engage in practical applications of physics, engineering, and mathematics. Through experimentation and problem-solving, they develop critical thinking skills and gain an appreciation for aerospace principles. Model rocketry fosters teamwork, creativity, and a passion for exploration, making it an invaluable tool for educators seeking to inspire the next generation of scientists and engineers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The American Rocketry Competition (TARC) is the largest model rocketry competition in the United States, designed to engage students and educators in hands-on STEM learning. Sponsored by the National Association of Rocketry (NAR) and the Aerospace Industries Association (AIA), TARC challenges teams to design, build, and launch model rockets to specific altitude and flight duration targets. With a focus on teamwork, innovation, and problem-solving, TARC inspires participants to explore aerospace concepts while preparing them for future careers in science and technology. The competition culminates in a thrilling national fly-off event, where top-performing teams showcase their skills and creativity.
